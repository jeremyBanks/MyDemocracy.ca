Archive of MyDemocracy.ca Results
=================================

Some time between `Feb 8 2017 and Feb 24 2017`__ the accessible HTML version of
the MyDemocracy.ca results report was removed from canada.ca and replaced with
just a PDF (``MyDemocracy.ca.pdf`` in this repository, or from
`epe.lac-bac.gc.ca`__).

This is a copy of the `archive.org archive`__ of the HTML results, with a
couple of stylistic improvements:

- Floating headers on all data tables
- Small bar graphs in all data tables
